## Introduction

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and managing styles is an essential part of any React application. This repository demonstrates multiple techniques for styling React components to help developers choose the best approach for their projects.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rasreal/react-styles.git
   cd react-styles
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

Explore the different styling approaches used in the components within the `src` folder. Each component demonstrates a unique way of applying styles, helping you understand how to integrate styles into your own React projects.

## Styling Methods

This repository covers the following CSS styling methods:

1. **Traditional CSS**:
   - Styles are defined in separate `.css` files and imported into React components. This method is straightforward and familiar to most web developers.

2. **CSS Modules**:
   - CSS Modules allow for scoped styles, preventing class name collisions by automatically generating unique class names. This method is useful for large applications where components may have overlapping class names.

3. **Styled-Components**:
   - Styled-components is a popular library that allows developers to write CSS in JavaScript. This method leverages tagged template literals to create styled React components, enabling dynamic styling based on props.

4. **Inline Styles**:
   - Inline styles can be applied directly to React components using the `style` attribute. While this method has its use cases, it can be limiting in terms of CSS features.
